🍫 Chocolates Sales Insights

📋 Project Overview

This project involves a comprehensive data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a chocolate sales dataset to extract actionable business insights. Our goal is to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies in the sales data and lay the groundwork for advanced predictive modeling.

👥 Team Members


🎯 Objectives

Clean and transform raw sales data into a structured format.

Identify trends across time, product categories, and regions.

Detect anomalies in revenue and discount patterns.

Explore relationships between features influencing chocolate sales.

Build a foundation for further strategic decision-making or predictive analytics.

🧹 Data Cleaning Steps

Removed duplicate records.

Standardized column names and data formats.

Corrected data types (e.g., date, numeric).

Imputed or removed missing values.

Validated data ranges and corrected outliers.

❓ Handling Missing Data

Mean/median imputation for numerical columns.

Mode imputation for categorical columns.

Forward-fill for time-series data.

Ensured data integrity post-imputation.

🛠️ Feature Engineering & Selection

Created derived metrics like Total Discount Impact and Average Revenue per Unit.

Removed irrelevant or low-variance features.

Encoded categorical variables (e.g., region, chocolate type).

Handled multicollinearity by removing highly correlated features.

✅ Data Consistency & Integrity

Standardized formats (dates, currency).

Validated calculations (e.g., revenue = units × price).

Corrected contradictory data entries.

📊 Summary Statistics Descriptive statistics (mean, median, std dev, range) for key fields.

Helped identify distribution patterns and variability in metrics.

📈 Trends & Anomalies Seasonal and regional sales trends analyzed.

Category-wise performance observed.

Outlier detection via boxplots, scatter plots.

Investigated data anomalies for potential market insights.

📉 Outliers & Transformations Identified outliers using Z-scores and boxplots.

Applied log transformations to reduce skewness.

Normalized distributions for accurate trend analysis.

🖼️ Visualizations Bar charts for revenue by category.

Line graphs showing time-series sales trends.

Boxplots for regional revenue comparisons.

Heatmaps for correlation analysis and missing data visualization.

🔚 Conclusion & Next Steps Dataset successfully cleaned and analyzed.

Key business insights extracted regarding product performance and customer trends.
